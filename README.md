# EX4: Prompt Design & Evaluation for IoT Manufacturing Automation

**Date:** 25-09-2025  
**Register Number:** 212223240033

## Aim
Create AI prompts of various types for a manufacturing scenario, test them on multiple AI tools, and evaluate using a rubric.

## Scenario
A manufacturing plant wants to reduce manual monitoring and improve efficiency using IoT devices and embedded controllers for predictive maintenance, automation, and real-time monitoring.

## Target Audience
Manufacturing companies in automotive, electronics, and food processing.

## Objectives
- Increase production efficiency by 30%
- Reduce machinery downtime
- Enable real-time monitoring & remote control
- Optimize energy consumption

## Prompt Types

### 1. Comparative Analysis Prompt
**Definition:** Compare two or more concepts, highlighting similarities and differences.  
**Example Prompt:** Compare IoT-based predictive maintenance vs traditional time-based maintenance in an automotive assembly line. Include workflow differences, cost, downtime, staffing, risks, and mitigation strategies. Conclude with a decision matrix recommending the best approach.  
**Use Case Application:** Helps management decide whether to invest in IoT systems or continue manual maintenance.

### 2. Experiential Perspective Prompt
**Definition:** Generate AI responses from a specific role or viewpoint.  
**Example Prompt:** Assume you are a plant manager at a food processing plant. Describe how IoT-based predictive maintenance affects daily operations, shift handovers, maintenance scheduling, and KPIs. List three quick wins and two long-term risks.  
**Use Case Application:** Provides practical insights from the operator’s perspective for decision-making.

### 3. Everyday Functioning Prompt
**Definition:** Explain technical concepts using familiar everyday examples.  
**Example Prompt:** Explain IoT predictive maintenance like using smart home devices (thermostats, smart fridges). Map analogies: Sensors → warning lights, Edge controllers → dashboard computers, Cloud analytics → smartphone apps.  
**Use Case Application:** Helps employees relate to IoT systems through familiar concepts.

### 4. Universal Prompt Structures
**Definition:** Standard, reusable templates for any concept.  
**Template:** Explain [concept] for [audience] in [format]. Include a one-sentence definition, step-by-step instructions (5 steps), and common troubleshooting tips (3 items).  
**Use Case Application:** Generates role-specific guides, SOPs, or checklists.

### 5. Prompt Size Limitations / Chunking
**Definition:** Split large prompts into smaller chunks for better AI response.  
**Prompt Example (Stepwise):**  
- Phase 1: Provide high-level architecture for IoT predictive maintenance (<500 words).  
- Phase 2: List hardware specs (sensors, controllers), network topology, and approximate costs.  
- Phase 3: Create a 2-year phased implementation plan with milestones and KPIs.  
**Use Case Application:** Manages complex tasks without overwhelming AI or readers.

## Evaluation
Use a rubric-based evaluation with criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Actionability, Specificity, Feasibility. Score 1–5 for each criterion per prompt output.

## Assets
Include diagrams or images representing the manufacturing scenario in the `assets/` folder (e.g., sensors, controllers, cloud system).
